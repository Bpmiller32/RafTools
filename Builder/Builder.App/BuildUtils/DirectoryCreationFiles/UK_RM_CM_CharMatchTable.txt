** Data version:    Y17M12
**
** This file contains characters that were found in the address and alias data that may not be represented in
** OCR-based address block input.  In order for SMI to fully match records containing these characters,
** mappings to common character alternates must be defined.
**
** For example, an 'Ö' may be recognized as an 'O' so the mapping "Ö -> O" should be made if 'Ö'
** is in the address data.  Note that these mappings only go from the left character (directory data
** character) to the right character (input character).
**
** Mappings are of one single character to another single character with a dash-greater than style arrow
** sign (->) in between.  A blank entry (for example "Ö ->") means the character on the left side maps
** to all other characters.  White space characters on the line are allowed and ignored.
** Comment lines begin with double asterisks (**) and blank lines are ignored.
**
** The Unicode code point (in hex) is included as a comment above each character.
