Crawler.Common refactor
- Cleanup()
- Setup appsettings
- CheckBuildReady()
- CheckFiles()
- WaitForDownload()

Can't DI refactor, AddSingleton doesn't have AddHostedService's Start, Stop, Exec  

✅ Add logins to appsettings
✅ Test for incorrect/expired logins (should fail on the WaitForElement)

✅ Redo appsettings with SmartMatch, RoyalMail, Parascript at top level
